        "1. Difference between interpreted and compiled languages\n",
        "   - Compiled languages (e.g., C, C++) are translated entirely into machine code before execution.\n",
        "   - Interpreted languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) are executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python\n",
        "   - Itâ€™s a mechanism to catch and handle runtime errors (exceptions) gracefully without stopping the program abruptly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Purpose of the finally block in exception handling\n",
        "   - The finally block contains code that always runs, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, often used for cleanup actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python\n",
        "   - Logging is the process of recording events, errors, or informational messages during program execution to help with debugging or auditing.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "   - __del__ is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed to free resources or perform cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Difference between import and from ... import in Python\n",
        "   - import module imports the entire module.\n",
        "   - from module import something imports specific attributes/functions/classes from the module.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How to handle multiple exceptions in Python\n",
        "   - Use multiple except blocks or a single block catching a tuple of exceptions, e.g.:\n",
        "\" try:\n",
        "    ...\n",
        "except (ValueError, TypeError):\n",
        "    ...\"\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python\n",
        "   - with ensures that the file is properly closed automatically after the block execution, even if exceptions occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Difference between multithreading and multiprocessing\n",
        "   - Multithreading runs multiple threads within a single process sharing memory.\n",
        "   - Multiprocessing runs separate processes with their own memory space, allowing true parallelism.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Advantages of using logging in a program\n",
        "   - Helps debug and trace program flow.\n",
        "   - Records errors for later analysis.\n",
        "   - Keeps audit trails.\n",
        "   - Can control output levels (info, debug, warning, error).\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python\n",
        "   - Automatic allocation, deallocation, and recycling of memory used by objects during program execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Basic steps involved in exception handling in Python\n",
        "   - try: code that may raise exceptions.\n",
        "   - except: code to handle exceptions.\n",
        "   - Optional else: code if no exception occurs.\n",
        "   - Optional finally: code that always runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python\n",
        "   - To prevent memory leaks and optimize resource usage for better performance and stability.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Role of try and except in exception handling\n",
        "   - try: defines a block to monitor for exceptions.\n",
        "   - except: handles the exceptions raised in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work\n",
        "   - Python uses reference counting plus a cyclic garbage collector to free memory of objects no longer referenced.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. Purpose of the else block in exception handling\n",
        "   - Code inside else runs only if the try block does not raise an exception, often used for code that should run after successful try.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Common logging levels in Python\n",
        "   - DEBUG\n",
        "   - INFO\n",
        "   - WARNING\n",
        "   - ERROR\n",
        "   - CRITICAL\n",
        "\n",
        "18. Difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python\n",
        "   - os.fork() creates a child process duplicating the parent (Unix only).\n",
        "   - multiprocessing is a cross-platform module to create processes with more control and features.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Importance of closing a file in Python\n",
        "   - Closing frees system resources and ensures data is properly written and saved to disk.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python\n",
        "   - read() reads the entire file or specified number of bytes.\n",
        "   - readline() reads one line at a time from the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for\n",
        "   - It provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling\n",
        "   - os provides functions to interact with the operating system, such as file and directory manipulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. Challenges associated with memory management in Python\n",
        "   - Handling cyclic references.\n",
        "   - Managing memory in multithreaded programs.\n",
        "   - Avoiding memory leaks from lingering references.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How to raise an exception manually in Python\n",
        "   - Using the raise keyword, e.g.:\n",

        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "   - To perform concurrent operations, especially for I/O-bound tasks, improving responsiveness and resource utilization."
